# cmd-open
An install that re-enables *Open command window here* in Windows 10.
It seems *Open command window here* was disabled in favor of *Open PowerShell window here*.
This install is for stubborn people, like myself, who still want *Open command window here*.

This install is based on the post *[Get back “Open command window here” context menu option in Windows 10 Creators Update](http://www.winhelponline.com/blog/cmd-here-windows-10-context-menu-add/)*,
but implemented as an install.

Re-enables the option *Shift + Right Click -> Open command window here* in Windows Explorer
